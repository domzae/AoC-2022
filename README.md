## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight
(EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code 2022 Story

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Context

**Completed during [Le Wagon x AoC](http://aoc.lewagon.community/).**

**These were not written as example of clean or efficient code** most were done as quickly as possible, some were done in ways to experiment with a particular paradigm, package or idea. Some are much more documented, probably because I wanted to share my code and needed it to be more readable!

## Running the code

Each day is in jupyter notebooks, and all cells should be runnable from top to bottom, and inputs are provided in the relavent folders. Some solutions may require additional packages to be installed. ðŸ™Œ
